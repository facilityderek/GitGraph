# GitGraph
Experiment in displaying Git repository graphs.

Tinkering withj displaying Git trees in a graphical manner. 

Initially using JGit and Jung Graphing libraries.

Project is a Maven POM. 

Reason for project: I'd like to be able to see a visual representation of Git repositories, which are a little
less cluttered than for instance: GitUI.

IDE of choice Netbeans 8+.

Standard Java Swing interface. Very early stages in development.
